1203. Scientific Conference

Time limit: 1.0 second
Memory limit: 64 MB

Functioning of a scientific conference is usually divided into several simultaneous sections. For example, there may be a section on parallel computing, a section on visualization, a section on data compression, and so on.
Obviously, simultaneous work of several sections is necessary in order to reduce the time for scientific program of the conference and to have more time for the banquet, tea-drinking, and informal discussions. However, it is possible that interesting reports are given simultaneously at different sections.
A participant has written out the time-table of all the reports which are interesting for him. He asks you to determine the maximal number of reports he will be able to attend.

Input
The first line contains the number 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 of interesting reports. Each of the next N lines contains two integers Ts and Te separated with a space (1 ≤ Ts < Te ≤ 30000). These numbers are the times a corresponding report starts and ends. Time is measured in minutes from the beginning of the conference.

Output
You should output the maximal number of reports which the participant can attend. The participant can attend no two reports simultaneously and any two reports he attends must be separated by at least one minute. For example, if a report ends at 15, the next report which can be attended must begin at 16 or later.

Sample Input
5
3 4
1 5
6 7
4 5
1 3

Sample output
3

Break Down
You will have a list of reports that are available, but you have to count the maximum number of reports you can attended straight forward.
A report consists of a initial time and an end.

Solution
I will make a struct called report consisting of two integer variables: start and end. Then I will have an array of N reports (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000), and it will be filled with the information of the input. Then I will sort the array by the end time, and I will go through it comparing the start time with the last report placed to determine the longest chain that can be attended

Analisis
You can not escape the fact of going through the entire arrangement of reports, for each traverse the complexity is O(n). To sort the list I used the function "sort" of the standard library "<algorithm>", its complexity its O(N*log2(N)). In total we will have a complexity of O(N*log2(N)) for solving this problem.

How to get the code working?
Compile: gcc proyecto1.cpp
Test: ./maintest.tcl ./a.out
